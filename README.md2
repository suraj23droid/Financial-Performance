Financial Performance Dashboard (Tableau)
Overview

This project explores company financial performance across (countries, products, and time
periods).
Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard that tracks (sales, profit, discounts, and
COGS ) to help identify profitable regions, product trends, and the impact of discounts on
revenue.

Objective

- Analyze sales and profit trends across countries and product categories
- Understand the relationship between discounts and revenue
- Calculate profitability metrics such as profit margin and cost-to-sales ratio
- Provide interactive filters for stakeholders to explore performance in detail

Tools & Technologies

- Tableau Desktop
- Microsoft Excel (dataset)

Key Features

- Country Performance : Sales & profit comparison across countries
- Trend Analysis : Line charts showing sales & profit over time
- Discount Analysis : Scatter plots to examine discounts vs gross sales
- Product Insights : Heat maps showing the effect of discount bands on products

Key Insights

- Some high-sales countries show low profit margins, indicating high costs
- Discounts above 20% start to reduce overall profitability
- Certain products maintain consistent profits regardless of discount strategy
